# **Rajesh Phulwaria — Personal Portfolio**

This repository contains my personal portfolio — a showcase of my journey from a self-taught beginner to a developer who experiments fast, builds aggressively, and turns curiosity into real projects.

## 🚀 **About Me**

I’m a developer who started from scratch and quickly learned to push beyond the basics.  
I enjoy building things that aren’t “safe” or predictable — from mathematical visualizations to UI/UX experiments, from 3D simulations to space-inspired trajectory models.

My process is simple:
- If something interests me, I build it.  
- If it breaks, I fix it.  
- If it works, I push it further.

Outside the tech grind, life stays grounded — a girlfriend who loves paneer, a dog that keeps things real, and a mind constantly turning random ideas into code.

## 🔥 **Highlights of What I Build**

- Interactive graph plotters using mathematical equations
- AI-powered UI/UX generation concepts  
- Billing systems, utility tools, and form handlers  
- Real-time hand gesture recognition using OpenCV  
- Small but useful Java and JavaScript programs
